# BulkManager-Unreal
Plugin for managing a bulk of actors with data through programmatic relevancy.

If you're considering this type of functionality, it's likely: [MassEntity](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/overview-of-mass-entity-in-unreal-engine/) would be more relevant. This plugin is meant to fill certain specific gaps in custom Actor<->ISM pipeline.
